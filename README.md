# Income-Classification-challenge
This is a project that aims at classifying incomes of individuals in a case provided with certain characteristics about them.
# 
For purposes of resource allocation, the government is very much interested in the incomes of all the households that fall within its jurisdiction. One way in which the government can obtain that information is through conducting a census. The census will provide the government with all the information it will need in making decisions pertaining resource allocation, taxation and better planning. For the government to do all this, they will require to gain insights on the incomes of individuals.
As data scientists we have been tasked by the government to come up with a model that can accurately predict the class of income an individual falls in for purposes of resource allocation and taxation by the relevant government agencies. We will then explore the various machine learning classification models and do a comparative analysis of the models to determine the one that performs best for our scenario and then work with that one for this particular project.
